# PlayaroundCompiler
Old Compiler/Interpreter school project.

This was a playaround project, compiling source code into an array of instructions further executed.

In `examples` folder there are some source code samples, hinting towards the language syntax.

Once a file opened in the app editor or written, it must be compiled, only after that is able to run.

In one file there may be several programs implemented. At runtime, a program must be started by typing its name in the Run console.
